Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money 
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on rats, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about 
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the tree. It is a way I have of driving off the 
car and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the depression; 
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my flower; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN>, and bringing up the rear of every cat I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the void, and methodically 
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> off—then, I account it high time to get to <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all grass in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the witch with me.
